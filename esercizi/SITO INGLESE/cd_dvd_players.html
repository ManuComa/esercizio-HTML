		<h1> CD AND DVD PLAYERS </h1>
		<h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
		<p> In the 2000s, a very important and significant device was a CD and DVD player. <br>

           The diameter of the CD is 120 mm,and it is thin about  1.2mm.

		<h2>PURPOSE OF THE OBJECT, POPULARITY AND AGE OF USERS </h2>
		<p> CD and DVD players are two devices  to listen to music by a CD or to watch a DVD on Tv.  
		Despite being born in the 80s, players became very popular after 2000, they were utilised by 
		people who liked listening to music and watching DVD.   <br>

			“my brother and I used them a lot, especially I used them for many hours in the afternoon 
			when I came back home from school”,
		</p>
		<h2> EVOLUTION </h2>
		<p>  These two technology devices have changed over time.                                                                                                 The CD player has had several transformations and changes over time, before it was known as a record player ("giradischi"), then in the early 2000s it assumed the name of a “CD player” and today this device still exists but in addition to a sector for inserting the cd, there they are add-ons such as USB ports. 
			About DVD players, before there were some players for videotapes (“videocassette”), 
			and over time they were used for playing DVD, also these objects had a lot of transformations 
			and now it has a USB port, too.
